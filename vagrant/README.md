Vagrant Boxes
=============

Yes, these are not Docker images.  However, until we get a docker runtime that can host MacOS guests, or until Windows fixes issues such as the fact that [pipes don't work properly for cygwin programs within Docker](https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/262), we rely on the beautiful infrastructure that Vagrant provides us.

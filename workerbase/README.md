buildworker docker images
=========================

To build Julia worker base docker images, first install [harbor](https://github.com/leethomas/harbor) with `gem install harbordock`, then run `make` in this directory.  The result will be docker images named things like `julia_workerbase_centos5:64` and `julia_workerbase_xenial:32`.  These images are what are deployed onto in order to create buildworkers, as these images contain things like very recent versions of `gcc`, `python`, `cmake`, etc...

To generate all the `Dockerfile`s without actually building the docker images, run `make all-Dockerfiles`.

To generate a `Dockerfile` and then build the result, run something like `make centos5-32`, or `make xenial-64`.

**NOTE:** This repository uses the new experimental `--squash` command introduced in Docker 1.13 in order to cut down on image sizes.  (Without `--squash` support, the `centos5-32` image is ~6.5 GB, with it it is ~1 GB) While the actual `Dockerfile`s generated by this repository do not have anything experimental within them, the `Makefile` within this repository will attempt to pass `--squash` to `docker build`.
